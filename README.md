There are three R scripts: R_clusterAnalysis.R, R_EM_algorithm.R and R_NIG_Simulations_cloud.R. I will next briefly outline the purpose of each of these scripts.

# Machine Learning Based Cluster Analysis of Randomizied Portfolio

# Parameter Estimation of Multivariate Stochastic Processes With Skew and Fat Tails

# Portfolio Simulation Using the Multivariate Normal Inverse Gaussian Process
